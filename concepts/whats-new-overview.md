# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](changelog.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.


## September 2020: New and generally available

### Calendar
GA of the **transactionId** property of the [event](/graph/api/resources/event) resource, which is optionally set by a client app to avoid redundant POST operations in case of client retries to create the same event. This is useful when low network connectivity causes the client to time out before receiving a response from the server for the client's prior create-event request.

### Cloud communications
[Delete a participant](/graph/api/participant-delete) from a [call](/graph/api/resources/call). You can use this operation even in situations where it's necessary to delete a participant from an active call.

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune [September](changelog.md#september-2020) updates for the v1.0 version.

### Identity and access | Directory management
GA of the [administrative units API](/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit) that allow organizations to subdivide their Azure Active Directory, manage and delegate administrative duties to these subdivisions. These subdivisions can represent regions, departments, cost centers, and so on.

### Reports
[Get a report that includes the count of unique users](/graph/api/reportroot-getemailappusageversionsusercounts) for Outlook 2019 and for Outlook on Microsoft 365.

### Teamwork
- Get the **lastEditedDateTime** property to find out when a sender last edits a [chat message](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage).
- Get the **lastModifiedDateTime** property to find out when a sender creates a chat message or when anyone modifies it in other ways, including adding or removing a reaction. 
- [Get notifications on changes](webhooks.md) in [chat messages](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage).
- [Update](/graph/api/chatmessage-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the **policyViolation** property of a [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessagepreserve-view=true) within a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel&preserve-view=true) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat&preserve-view=true), enabling data loss prevention (DLP) apps to monitor [chat message policy violation](/graph/api/resources/chatmessagepolicyviolation?preserve-view=true) to prevent messages from containing data that users are not supposed to send.

### Use the SDKs
GA of the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell) which enables access to the entire surface of Microsoft Graph in a straightforward and consistent way.

### Use the Toolkit
Try the new step-by-step getting-started tutorials for Microsoft Graph Toolkit and experience the convenience the toolkit brings:
- [Build a web application in JavaScript](./toolkit/get-started/build-a-web-app.md)
- [Build a SharePoint web part](./toolkit/get-started/build-a-sharepoint-web-part.md)
- [Build a Microsoft Teams tab](./toolkit/get-started/build-a-microsoft-teams-tab.md)
- [Use the toolkit with React](./toolkit/get-started/use-toolkit-with-react.md)
- [Use the toolkit with Angular](./toolkit/get-started/use-toolkit-with-angular.md)

### Users
Aside from getting the SMTP address of a [user](/graph/api/resources/user) through the **mail** property, you can now set that property and update the user's email address. 

## September 2020: New in preview only

### Cloud communications
- Deprecation of the **autoAdmittedUsers** property of [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). Instead, use the new **lobbyBypassSettings** property and its [values](/graph/api/resources/lobbybypasssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#lobbybypassscope-values).
- Use additional settings about announcing callers joining or leaving an online meeting (**isEntryExitAnnounced** property), and allowing specific presenters in the meeting (**allowedPresenters** property).

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
- [Get the documents for each of the print jobs associated with a printer](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), by applying an `$expand` [OData system query option](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#optional-query-parameters). 
- Filter print jobs by the user who created them, by applying a `$filter` [OData system query option](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#optional-query-parameters).

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune [September](changelog.md#september-2020) updates for the beta version.

### Identity and access | Directory management
[Get a BitLocker recovery key](/graph/api/bitlockerrecoverykey-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) on behalf of the signed-in user who's the device owner or in an appropriate role. Getting a recovery key generates an [audit log](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs), in parity with the end user experience.

### Identity and access | Governance
Be able to include a [schedule](/graph/api/resources/requestschedule?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) when requesting or removing an [assignment of a user to an access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), that specifies access to groups, applications, or SharePoint sites.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Organizations can [get](/graph/api/continuousaccessevaluationpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [update](/graph/api/continuousaccessevaluationpolicy-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a [continuous access evaluation policy](/graph/api/resources/continuousAccessEvaluationPolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to manage authentication sessions in real time.

  - Scope properties in search results to [selected properties](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#get-selected-properties). 
  - Get custom properties on [listItem](/graph/api/resources/listitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources.

  - [Refine results using aggregations](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#refine-results-using-aggregations) for OneDrive and SharePoint.
- Query external data ingested by Microsoft Graph connectors across [more than one connection](./search-concept-custom-types.md).
- Take advantage of enhanced content for Microsoft Graph connectors to learn about:
  - [Managing connections](search-index-manage-connections.md)

External groups can represent non-Azure Active Directory groups or group-like constructs, such as business units, that determine permissions over the content in the external data source.

### Teamwork
- Get the date/time at which a Teams [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) is created.

The possible status values are `submitted`, `published`, and `rejected`. See an [example](/graph/api/teamsapp-list?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#example-3-list-applications-with-a-given-id-and-return-the-submission-review-state).
- Use the `AppCatalog.Submit` delegated permission to allow a user to [submit an app](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish) and request administrator review. Use the same permission for a user to [cancel](/graph/api/teamsapp-delete) an app submitted in the past that has not been published. 


## August 2020: New in preview only

### Applications
Support password-based single-sign-on in [service principal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) application resources and specify such [settings](/graph/api/resources/passwordsinglesignonsettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in the **passwordSingleSignOnSettings** property.
