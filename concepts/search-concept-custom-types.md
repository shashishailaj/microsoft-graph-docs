# Use the Microsoft Search API to search custom types imported using Microsoft Graph connectors

Use the Microsoft Search API to search accross content ingested and indexed by [Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview). The content is imported either via [built-in connectors](/microsoftsearch/connectors-gallery) provided by Microsoft, or via custom connectors implemented using the [Microsoft Graph connectors ingestion API](/graph/api/resources/indexing-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE [search-api-preview-signup](../includes/search-api-preview-signup.md)]

[!INCLUDE [search-schema-updated](../includes/search-schema-updated.md)]

Once the content has been imported and indexed, you can use the search API to query the content.

To search for custom types, specify the following properties in the request body of the [query](/graph/api/search-query?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method:

- The **contentSources** property to include the connection ID that is assigned during the connector setup. You can pass multiple connection IDs to search across multiple connections. Results are returned in a single list, ranked accross the multiple connections.

-->

- The **entityTypes** property as `externalItem`.

- The **fields** property to include the fields in the external item to retrieve. Note that if you do not include any **fields** in the request, the response will contain all the fields marked as *retrievable* in the data schema specified for the specified connections in the **contentSources** property.

## Example

In this example, the content of the [AdventureWorks](/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure) database has been ingested using the Azure SQL built-in connector.
