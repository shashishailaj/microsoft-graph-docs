# List members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the group's direct members. A group can have users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals and other groups as members. Currently service principals are not listed as group members due to staged roll-out of service principals on Graph V1.0 endpoint. This operation is not transitive.
