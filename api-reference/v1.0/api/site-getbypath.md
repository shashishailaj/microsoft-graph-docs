# Get a site resource by path

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.

[site]: ../resources/site.md

In addition to retrieving a [site by ID](site-get.md) you can retrieve a site based on server-relative URL path.

* Site collection hostname (contoso.sharepoint.com)
* Site path, relative to server hostname.

There is also a reserved site identifier, `root`, which always references the root site for a given target, as follows:

* `/sites/root`: The tenant root site.
* `/groups/{group-id}/sites/root`: The group's team site.

## Permissions
