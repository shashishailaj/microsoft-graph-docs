# Working with the authentication methods usage report API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The authentication methods usage reports help you understand how users in your organization use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) capabilities, such as self-service password rest and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

These reports provide information such as:

- Which authentication methods are more successful for your organization. 
- What types of errors end users are running into.
- What campaign you need to run to help your end users adopt the use of self-service password rest and MFA.
